What time is it? Time for you to... Qwiic-ly build a GPS clock and output it to a display! This project provides you with the current date and time using GPS satellites. Depending on your display, you can draw the time as a digital or analog clock. Or even configure the clock to read military time, adjust the clock for your time zone, or automatically adjust the time for daylight savings time!
